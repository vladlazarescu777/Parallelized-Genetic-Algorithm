# Parallelized-Genetic-Algorithm

  Starting from the sequential implementation, I wrote a parallel (Multi-threading) program which runs a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem.
  The evolution starts from a random population. The individuals' quality is sorted with a fitness function and for the next generation the individuals chosen have the best fitness scores. Also, crossover is used to obtain information of the children by combining genetic information from parents and mutation is used to give genetic diversity.
  The genetic algorithm stops after a maximum number of generations or the current generation is a solution of the problem.
